# The Chat
A simple chatting react app made for desktop use

## Description
In our app you can chat with other users by choosing a contact and sending messages from different types: text messages, images, videos and audio recordings.
The first screen that appears when first opening the app is the login screen. You can register a new account by pressing the link at the bottom side of the form.

The link will send you to the register page where you can pick a username a display name and a password.
The username and display name must be at least 2 characters long and the password must be between 6-14 characters long.
All textboxes must be filled correctly to proceed.

After logging in you'll arrive at the main chat page where you can either choose from a selection of 5 already existing contacts to chat by pressing on the chosen contact at the menu in the left side of the screen or add a new contact to chat with: "simha" by pressing the add contact icon at the top of the contact menu.

After picking a contact to chat with you can send text messages by typing the message in the textbox at the bottom of the chat section of the screen and press the arrow button to send.

In order to send other types of messages (image, video or audio recording) simply press the paperclip icon near the textbox for text messages and choose one of 3 options. Choosing an option would open a popup explaining how to send the message, follow the instructions and press send to confirm.
